Casting a canvas from any modern web browser directly to a chromecast. Useful for games or any other CPU/GPU intensive presentations that the chromecast isn't capable of. Write visually beautiful HTML5 games that run on your phone/tablet but display on the Chromecast using an offscreen canvas.

Notes: There is some lag as with any form of screen casting.
